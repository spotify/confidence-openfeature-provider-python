## Contributing

We ask you to write well covered unit tests with your changes and please make sure you use `black` and `flake8` to lint your code before making a PR. There are CI checks that will fail otherwise.

We require pull request titles to follow the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and we also encourage individual commits to adher to that.

We use "squash merge" and any merge PR title will show up in the changelog based on the title.
